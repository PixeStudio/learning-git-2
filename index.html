            Pigs on the Wing (Part I)

            If you didn't care what happened to me,
            And I didn't care for you
            We would zig zag our way
            through the boredom and pain
            Occasionally glancing up through the rain
            Wondering which of the buggers to blame
            And watching for pigs on the wing.

            You gotta be crazy,
            You gotta have a real need
            You gotta sleep on your toes,
            When you're on the street
            You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat
            With your eyes closed
            And then moving in silently,
            Down wind and out of sight
            You gotta strike when the moment is right
            Without thinking.
